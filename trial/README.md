## Week 1 Goals
- [x] Install software
- [ ] Research terms
- [x] Data set exploration (through code)
- [ ] Experiment with data types
- [ ] Experiment with sample point data

## Why does sample_points_processing exist?
Running the eval script takes up to half an hour depending on network conditions so taking the data I could gather and putting it in a csv
was a better idea to continue experimenting with how to better organize that data than waiting to be able to do so every 30 minutes.
