## Week 2 Goals
- [ ] Experiment with data formatting
- [ ] Look into redundancy checks. For events like power outage, internet loss, etc.

## Why does sample_points_processing exist?
Running the eval script takes up to half an hour depending on network conditions so taking the data I could gather and putting it in a csv
was a better idea to continue experimenting with how to better organize that data than waiting to be able to do so every 30 minutes.
